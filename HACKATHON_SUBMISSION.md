## About the project

### Inspiration
I am not a professional programmer, but I have spent years working in esports with the world’s top teams and organizing promotional events at major video game fairs. Having seen firsthand what excites fans, I wanted to create a unique engagement activity for **Cloud9**—something that would allow them to take home a personalized souvenir with their idols while helping the team amplify its social media presence through user-generated content.

When I saw the opportunity to build this using AI and learn during the process, I didn't hesitate. The goal was simple but ambitious: create a seamless "Roster Moment" where any fan could instantly become part of the pro team.

### What it does
**Cloud9 Roster Moment** is an interactive web experience for live events.
1.  **The Fan Experience:** A user takes a selfie or uploads a photo.
2.  **The AI Magic:** Using **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro**, the app analyzes the fan's face and seamlessly integrates them into a high-quality, branded team poster alongside 5 current Cloud9 pro players.
3.  **The Delivery:** The fan instantly receives the poster via a branded email (built with **Brevo**) ready to share on social media.
4.  **The Event Buzz:** Simultaneously, the generated image appears on a live "Gallery" TV display at the booth, and real-time stats update on an organizer's dashboard.

### How we built it
We built this project using a "pair programming" approach with AI agents.
*   **Core AI engine:** We utilized **Google Gemini via the Vertex AI / Studio SDK** for its multimodal capabilities. The key was designing complex prompts that instructed the model to respect the fan's facial features ("Identity Preservation") while strictly following the Cloud9 artistic style.
*   **Backend:** A Node.js and Express server orchestrates the flow. It handles image upload, prompt engineering for Gemini, and file management.
*   **Database:** We implemented a local **SQLite** database to track subscribers, consents, and image metadata for the gallery.
*   **Email Infrastructure:** Integration with **Brevo's REST API** ensures reliable delivery of the heavy image attachments, bypassing standard SMTP port blocks often found in cloud hosting.
*   **Frontend:** A mobile-first Vanilla JS interface for the user, coupled with a separate clean "TV Mode" for public displays.

### Challenges we ran into
The journey from concept to "production-ready" prototype wasn't easy:
1.  **Identity vs. Style:** Initially, the AI would either persist the face perfectly but ignore the art style, or apply the style so heavily the fan became unrecognizable. We solved this with a **"Strict Role Assignment"** prompt strategy, explicitly defining "Image 1" as the protagonist (The Fan) and "Images 2-6" as supporting cast.
2.  **Deployment Nightmares:** Moving from `localhost` to **Render** broke our file serving logic. Generated images weren't appearing immediately because the file system and public URL paths weren't in sync. We had to build a custom `GET /generated/:filename` route with explicit file system checks to ensure images were served correctly the millisecond they were created.
3.  **Email Deliverability:** Sending large base64 images via standard nodemailer transports failed in the cloud environment. Migrating to a trusted API-based sender (Brevo) was critical to ensure fans actually received their posters.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
*   **It actually works!** Seeing the first proper image come back with my face wearing a Cloud9 jersey standing next to the pros was a "magic moment."
*   **The "Pro" Feel:** We spent a lot of time on details—the "Rajdhani" esports font, the dark mode aesthetics, and the live dashboard. It looks like a real product you'd see at a major tournament.
*   **Learning Curve:** Going from "I have an idea" to "I have a deployed web app with database and AI integration" in a short time was an incredible learning experience.

### What we learned
AI isn't just a code generator; it's a teacher. I learned about file buffers, asynchronous `await` pitfalls, and the importance of environment variables. We also learned that **prompt engineering is engineering**—getting the prompt right was just as hard as writing the JavaScript logic.

### What's next for Cloud9 Roster Moment
*   **Animated Avatars:** Using video-generation models to make the "Roster Moment" come alive with movement.
*   **Physical Printing:** Integrating with on-site dye-sublimation printers for instant physical cards.
*   **Multi-Team Support:** Scaling the backend to support multiple esports organizations with dynamic asset loading.
